<h2>Anisah Abdullah</h2>
<img src="anisah.jpg" alt="Anisah Abdullah" width= 308px height= 376px>
<p>Anisah Abdullah is an emerging professional interning at King County International Airport. During Fall 2020, she became a student at one of the 
    leading non-profit organizations in the nation that aims to close the opportunity divide, the Year Up Program. After a rigorous application process, 
    she was accepted into the program and continues to thrive to become a successful Asian-Muslim software developer. She works hard to pave an opportune 
    future for her children and to be a leading example. She is motivated and excited to see where her journey lands her in the corporate industry.</p>
<p>She is an emerging professional that will never stop… Over a year ago, she returned to the US with no idea what her future would hold
     for her and her children. Upon hearing the news that she would return to the states, she knew that she didn’t want to see her children have to 
     go through the hardships of taking on responsibilities at a young age like she did. She did not want them to be striped of the opportunity to become 
     their best selves. That is when she knew that she had to work hard to become the support system for them that she did not have. She has faced many 
     challenges in her life from losing family members to raising children on my own. But one thing that will never change is that she will never stop. 
     She will never stop working towards making a better future for her children, she will never stop thriving to be self-sufficient, and she will never 
     stop trying to achieve to the best. As Jeffrey Gitomer says “Obstacles can’t stop you. Problems can’t stop you. Only you can’t stop you.”</p>
